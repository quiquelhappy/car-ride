# car-ride
allows to share gas/travel expenses between multiple people

# why?
I created this solution so I can share ride expenses with my friend at uni. I'm always the one driving, and creating an excel with the amount of times my friend was on my car, plus how many km I made every single time (with the time it takes to update an excel file) wasn't worth it
